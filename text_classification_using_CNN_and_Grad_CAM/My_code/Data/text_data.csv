"Nausea, diarrhea, shakiness, fatigue and feeling cold all experienced from this drug.",0
"Well besides the constant diarrhea, everything else is good.",1
"Taking 500 mg per day. Some stomach discomfort right away and brief diarrhea. In the 3rd week the full drug kicked in. Due to the severe weakness, muscle cramping, sleeplessness, tiredness, chest pain and discomfort, flu like symptoms and shortness of breath I have had to stop the medication. I am so sick I fear this med may kill me. I am stopping and trying to treat more aggressively with diet and exercise. This drug is not for me.",0
"I am thankful that Metformin has kept me from having Type 2 Diabetes however the reviews of how harmful this medication is scares me. I am 63 years old and have taken this medication for at least 10 years now I am not exactly sure when I started it!",1
"Only on medication for 2 months but lost 14 pounds during that time. I am no longer constantly hungry and irritable. Initially gave me some stomach discomfor but the only remaining side effect I have is terrible constipation.",1
"Brain fog, headaches",0
"I do feel some insomnia is involved when I take this pill before bed rather than after a meal.",0
"Had headaches every day and dizziness everyday for about 2 weeks. Cut back dosage to one per day. After 4 weeks, went back on prescribed 2 per day. At 3 months blood test results showed significant decrease in A1C and some weight loss. At 6 months A1C levels are normal and weight loss has been 15 pounds. I feel great and exercising everyday. I eat a healthy diet of 4 small meals everyday, even when traveling. I carry my healthy snacks in small cooler in the car. I've also cut back on red meat to about once a month. Cut back on dairy (all types) to about once a week.",1
"I lost 20 pounds in just a few months on this medication. I didn't like the smell, so I held my breath when taking it. And, I took it with dinner which I think helped with some of the side effects others experienced. I think it is effective. The pills are very cheap.",1
"Gas diarrhea blood sugar levels were good but after about six weeks of taking 500 mg daily started experiencing joint pain in shoulders knees and really bad back pain so stopped meds and pain subsided but not completely",1
"Been using Metformin for 3 weeks. Bad diarrhea first few days and nausea. Now occasional nausea. Lost 8 pounds and I feel good.",0
"Metformin has worked to lower my blood sugar especially in keeping my glucose under 100 in morning. I have experienced minor cramping but no diarrhea. Dr prescribed 2/500mil per day but it controls with one pill at night. Only side effect is nightmares and vivid dreams. Does anyone have nightmares/vivid dreams.",1
"I am suppose to take medicine (500mg)twice a day but the stomach cramps, diarrhea, and dizziness made me take it only 1 a day, with same effects. I now take half a tablet in the morning after breakfast and half after dinner. Still some stomach discomfort but not as bad. Continuing medication since I just started about 2 weeks ago.",0
"My doctor told me I was pre-diabectic. My a1c was 5.8. I had been having problems with gaining excess weight so she put me on metformin she said I may lose weight now but instead I didn't. It actually kept me from gaining more weight but no weight loss. I was taking 750 once a day and all of a sudden I notice my hair started falling out. I stopped the medication even though hair loss is not one of the side effects. Has anyone else had this problem?",0
"My doctor prescribed 1000 mg a day in the form of two 500 mg pills a day after I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic. Since taking the medication, my A1C has dropped to 5.4 at last check, so I believe a combination of the medication and lifestyle changes have helped. Unfortunately, ever since I have started the medication, I suffer from very frequent diarrhea, fecal urgency or outright incontinence (a few times). It was worse in the beginning, but it does make it difficult to take the medication as prescribed at times.",1
"Took 500 mg twice daily for a year after A1C went up to 6.6. After a year, A1C dropped to 5.9, BUT my eGFR (kidney function) fell from 72.2 to 56.4. Stopped taking Metformin last April and eGFR rose to 65.1 after less than one month. Since May of this year, eGFR has stabilized at around 59 but A1C is back up to 6.5 My PCP thinks I should not go back on Metformin due to the previous decline in my kidney function. If A1C continues to rise, she may put me on Farxiga, which can also lower eGFR. Also had chronic diarrhea occurring about every 10 to 14 days while on Metformin.",0
